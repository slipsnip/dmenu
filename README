dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
my fork of suckless.org's dmenu tool, with applied patches and other modifications so i can just clone this when I distro hop.
I recomend going directly to [www.suckless.org][1] and cloning the official `git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu`
and applying the patches you want.
